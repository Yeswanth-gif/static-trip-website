        Mayapur (MayƒÅpura), previously known as Miyapur, is a neighbourhood of Bamanpukur, 
        West Bengal, India, situated adjacent to Nabadwip, at the confluence of two rivers, 
        where the waters of the Jalangi River mix with Bhagirathi, a distributary of the Ganges. 
        It is located about 130 km north of Kolkata. Along with Nabadwip, it is considered a spiritual 
        place by the adherents of Gaudiya Vaishnavism

        It is said to be the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The headquarters of ISKCON
         is situated in Mayapur. 
         It is said that the Supreme personality of godhead Krishna appeared along with his brother 
         Balarama, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu. 
         These two brothers appeared just for the fallen conditioned souls of this Kali Yuga to bestow on 
         them the greatest blessings of Harinama Sankirtan based on the teachings of Bhagvad Gita and Shrimad Bhagavatam. 
         Along with their associates, the Pancha Tattva, they distributed the divine Love of Godhead to anyone and everyone without seeing any qualifications or disqualifications. 
         Mayapur is where the Material and Spiritual Worlds meet. Just as there is no difference between Lord Chaitanya and Lord Krishna, similarly there is no difference between Shridham Mayapur and Vrindavan.
