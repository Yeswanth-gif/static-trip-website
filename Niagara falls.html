        Niagara Falls, waterfall on the Niagara River in northeastern North America, one of the continent’s most famous spectacles. The falls lie on the border between Ontario, Canada, and New York state, U.S. For many decades the falls were an attraction for honeymooners and for such stunts as walking over the falls on a tightrope or going over them in a barrel. Increasingly, however, the appeal of the site has become its beauty and uniqueness as a physical phenomenon.

        Niagara Falls, city and port, Niagara county, western New York, U.S. It lies at the great falls of the Niagara River, opposite the city of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and about 8 miles (15 km) northwest of Buffalo. The British built Fort Schlosser there in 1761, and in 1805 or 1806 Augustus Porter established a grist mill and a settlement called Manchester. Both the settlement and the fort were burned by the British during the War of 1812, but development of the surrounding farmlands continued; the villages of Manchester, Suspension Bridge, and Clarksville (later to merge into Niagara Falls) grew up along the river. The Niagara River’s hydroelectric potential began to be developed in 1881, and, with the formation of the Niagara Falls Power Company in 1878, the industrial future of the city was assured. Its hydroelectric plants supply power to much of New York state and to the city’s electrochemical, electrometallurgical, and aerospace industries. Other economically important manufactures include paper, abrasives, machinery, electrical equipment, and food products

        The Niagara Falls State Park (established 1885) includes Prospect Park (site of the Schoellkopf Geological Museum with exhibits on the history and formation of the falls) and areas along the river, including Luna, Goat, and other smaller islands. Tourism is a major economic factor, with millions of visitors coming to view the falls each year. Rainbow Bridge, which was completed in 1941 to replace the Falls View Bridge that collapsed in 1938, is one of several that cross the river downstream from the falls. Niagara County Community College, part of the State University of New York system, was founded in the city in 1962, and Niagara University (1856) is situated just outside the city limits. Tuscarora Indian Reservation is about 7 miles (11 km) northeast. Inc. city, 1892. Pop. (2000) 55,593; Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metro Area, 1,170,111; (2010) 50,193; Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metro Area, 1,135,509.
